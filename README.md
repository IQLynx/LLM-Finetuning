# **Fine-Tuning AI Models**

Welcome to the **Fine-Tuning AI Models** repository! This repository is dedicated to fine-tuning cutting-edge AI models in computer vision, text generation, and speech recognition. We focus on optimizing pre-trained models to enhance their performance for specific tasks and applications.

## **Models Covered**

### **Computer Vision Models**

We fine-tune popular deep learning models for image recognition, object detection, and segmentation:

- **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** – Real-time object detection.
- **EfficientNet** – High-performance image classification.
- **ResNet** – Deep residual networks for image recognition.
- **Vision Transformers (ViTs)** – Transformer-based image analysis.
- **SAM (Segment Anything Model)** – Advanced image segmentation.

### **Text Generation Models**

We fine-tune state-of-the-art NLP models to improve text understanding and generation:

- **GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)** – OpenAI's powerful text generator.
- **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** – Contextual word embeddings for NLP.
- **LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI)** – Meta's open-source language model.
- **DeepSeek** – Next-generation language understanding and generation model.
- **Falcon** – Efficient transformer-based text model.

### **Speech Recognition Models**

We fine-tune speech-to-text models for improved transcription accuracy:

- **Whisper** – OpenAI's robust automatic speech recognition (ASR) model.
- **DeepSpeech** – Mozilla’s open-source speech recognition system.

## **Repository Structure**

This repository consists of **Colab Notebooks** for fine-tuning different models. You can open and run them directly in Google Colab.

## **Getting Started**

To use the notebooks in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IQLynxAI/LLM-Finetuning.git
```

2. Open the desired **Colab Notebook** and run the cells to fine-tune the model of your choice.
